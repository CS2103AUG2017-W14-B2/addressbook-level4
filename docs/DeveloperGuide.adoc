== Software Overview

Augustine is a virtual Address Book that seeks to assist students who are currently pursuing their studies in National
University of Singapore (NUS). As a virtual Address Book, Augustine is a comprehensive
software to store contact details of their friends. This enables students to take advantage of
technology to assist them in managing aspects of their daily life and easily query contact details of their friends at
any time without a need to refer to a physical Address Book (which might get lost) when they require a friend’s contact details.

In Augustine, users primarily communicate with the software via Command Line Interface (CLI). Augustine also contains a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) component to provide visual feedback to commands that are performed.

Developed in Java, Augustine can cater to all students in NUS as it runs in both Windows and Unix environment.

== About

This Developer Guide seeks to assist both experienced and new developers that are either interested in contributing to
the development of Augustine or wishes to know more about its underlying mechanisms.

The Developer Guide will first cover the prerequisites for Augustine before covering on
various components in Augustine, in-depth explanation on the implementation of certain mechanisms in Augustine and design considerations
behind those implementations and the documentation of what the development team underwent
to make Augustine to what it is today.

== Getting Started
Before proceeding further with the Developer Guide, ensure that you have achieved the following requirements:

=== Prerequisites
Please install the following:

. *Java SE Development Kit* (JDK) `v1.8.0_60` or later. +
You can download the latest JDK from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here]

[NOTE]
Augustine will *not work* with any version of Java earlier than `Java 8.6`.

[start=2]
. *Intellij IDEA* Integrated Development Environment (IDE). +
You can download Intellij IDEA IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here]

[NOTE]
Either version of Intellij IDEA IDE will work.

By default, Intellij IDEA IDE has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. Ensure that both Gradle and JavaFx plugins are enabled.
If you have disabled them, go to `File > Settings > Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. *Fork* this repo to your own Github account, and *clone* the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ IDEA IDE and you should see the Welcome Screen.

[NOTE]
If you do not see the welcome screen, click `File > Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.

. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of your JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Press kbd:[Ctr; + Tab + T] *simultaneously* to open a console in Intellij IDEA IDE and execute the following command:
- For Windows   : `gradlew processResources`
- For Mac/Linux : `./gradlew processResources`

[NOTE]
The command should finish executing with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `src\main\java\seedu\address\MainApp.java` in Intellij IDEA IDE and try executing a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run all tests] by right clicking on the `src/test/java` folder in Intellij IDEA IDE and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
*Ensure* that all test cases pass before you start coding.

=== Configurations to do before coding
Now that you have successfully imported Augustine's source code into your computer, do ensure that you have completed the following before
you commence coding:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows the coding standard set forth by https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic].

While IntelliJ IDEA IDE default style is mostly compliant with it, minor modifications to the default settings is required to fully comply
with our coding standard.

Apply the following modifications to tweak the settings to comply with our coding standard:

. Go to:
- For Windows/Linux : `File > Settings...`.
- For macOS         : `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences...`.
. Select `Editor > Code Style > Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the
import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`,
`import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

[TIP]
You can also configure IntelliJ IDE to assist you in checking for style-compliance as you code. See <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>>
to learn how to configure it.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a
separate product instead of contributing to `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main`, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in both
`DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your forked repo.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

CI tools such as Travis and AppVeyor should be set up to prevent integration problems during development.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>) to learn how to set them up.

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures Augustine works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms as
Travis checks for Unix-based platforms while AppVeyor checks for Windows-based platforms.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Understand the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Software Architecture

This section covers how Augustine is designed while also providing an overview of the components in Augustine.

=== Architecture Design

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Augustine. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

===== Overview

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

** At Augustine's launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
** At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level:

** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
** `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to Augustine's log file.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : Interacts with user through the user interface (UI) of Augustine.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes commands specified by user.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of Augustine in-memory.
* link:#email-component[*`Email`*] : Sends email via JavaMail API.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

====
*Structure of `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `Email` component*

Each of the five components (UI, Logic, Model, Storage and Email)

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

====

=== Architecture Style

Augustine implements an Event-drive architecture style as explained below.

===== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 1 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
The `Model` simply raises an `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without the `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

---

=== Components

This section covers an overview of some of the components in the architecture.

==== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Structure of the UI component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of smaller parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LeftDisplayPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `MessageDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` and `BrowserPanel`. All of these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component
The Logic Component is where the user input is being parsed and the corresponding commands
are being called from. The newly created command is then executed and depending on the
command executed, the Model component may be accessed.

_Figure X_ below shows an Overview of the process within Logic Component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

_Figure X_ below shows the detailed process of how the Command class in the Logic Component works

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 4.3.1a_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The process of the Logic Component is as follow:

. LogicManager is called by `handleCommandInputChange` method in the UI Component and User Input is passed into LogicManager.
. LogicManager calls AddressBookParser to parse User Input into two Strings, commandWord and arguments.
. AddressBookParser calls the relevant CommandParser, if it exists and parse the arguments into a fixed format.
If there is no relevant CommandParser, AddressBookParser will call the Command instead.

  [NOTE]
  The Clear, List, History, Exit, Help, Undo, Redo commands do not have it's own CommandParser

. Relevant CommandParser then calls the actual Command to execute the user command.
. Command executes the user command.
. Model component may then be updated depending on the Command Type.

  [TIP]
  Model Component will be called by Add, Delete, Clear, Edit, Find, List, Redo and Undo command.

. the result of the Command which is stored in CommandResult will then be returned to LogicManager
. The CommandResult is then returned to `handleCommandInputChange` method in the UI Component for display to the user.

_Figure X_ below shows the sequence diagram of the process within the Component when the command
`Delete 1` is entered by the user.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Sequence Diagram within the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

==== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.3 : Structure of the Model component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores an `Email` component which handle sending email via JavaMail API
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Email component

image::EmailComponent.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.4 : Structure of the Email component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/email/Email.java[`Email.java`]

The `Email` component,

* uses a `EmailLogin` class to store user's email login Details.
* uses a `EmailSend` class to process and send email via JavaMail link:#API[API] through link:#SMTP[SMTP] protocol.
* uses a `EmailCompose` class to store the data of email message drafts.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `MessageDraft` object which can be retrieved from `EmailCompose` class, such that the `MessageDisplay` UI can be bound to this list which automatically updates when the data in the `messageDraft` object change.

// tag::StorageComponent[]
==== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.5 : Structure of the Storage component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

// end::StorageComponent[]

==== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modify the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

===== Implementation Details

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

===== UndoableCommands

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the above diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks needs to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while its child classes implements the details of the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

===== UndoRedoStack

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand`#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +

* **Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
* **Cons:** It will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +

* **Pros:** It does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
* **Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +

* **Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
* **Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +

* **Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
* **Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
* **Additional Info:** See our discussion at https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +

* **Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
* **Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +

* **Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
* **Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
====
---

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.
The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).

There are four different logging levels you can specify depending on the amount of verbosity you want:

* `SEVERE` : Critical errors detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Errors which are not crucial
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
The config file and path is specified in the `Config` class.

The `Config` class will be initialized by the `MainApp` and the constructed `Config` object will be kept as a protected variable.
When initialized, the `Config` class will read and save the values of parameters in the configuration file. The `MainApp` then passes the `Config` object into classes which require it (e.g. `MainWindow`)

// tag::optionalfields[]
=== Optional Fields in a Contact

A user may not know all the details of a contact when adding the contact into Augustine. Hence, Augustine only requires the user to know both the Name
and the Email of a contact to add the contact into Augustine. Unfilled details of a contact will be given a '-' value instead to denote that the
detail is not filled up by the user.

_Figure X_ below shows you the sequence diagram of the process within Augustine when a user adds a contact.

[caption="Figure X: "]
.Sequence diagram of add command.
image::AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

===== Implementation Details

As seen in _Figure X_ above, the `AddCommandParser` class is used to parse the input entered by the user into the different fields for a contact.

In `AddCommandParser`, Augustine will do the following. +

. Call `arePrefixPresent` method to check if the two compulsory prefixes, n/ and t/, which are used for the name and email fields respectively are
present.
.. If the two compulsory prefixes are not present, Augustine will throw an error message to the user.
. Execute the `checkInput` method to determine if a field is filled by the user. If the field is not filled,
the method will give the value '-' to the field instead to denote that the field is not filled by the user.

The code snippet below shows how the `checkInput` method checks if a field is filled by the user.

[source,java]
----
private static Optional<String> checkInput(Optional<String> userInput) {
        return Optional.of(userInput.orElse(UNFILLED));
    }
----

[start = 3]
. Call the `parseField` method in `ParserUtil` to parse the user input method into the different objects required for the `Person` object.

[NOTE]
The `Field` mentioned above refer to the different field available for a contact in Augustine. E.g. name, email.

[start = 4]
. Create the `Person` object, call the `AddCommand` class and pass in the newly created `Person` object as an parameter.

The result of `AddCommand` will then be displayed to the user.

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Detecting unfilled fields in user input#

====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if value is present, if value is not present, return a '-' as the value instead. +

* **Pros:** Simple to implement and for developers to understand. +
* **Cons:** All fields are still stored in AddressBook, leading to wastage of data space as fields that are not used by the User for
each contact are still being stored. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Detecting if the field exist in AddressBook.xml, if the field does not exist for a contact, display the field in the PersonCard as unfilled. +

* **Pros:** It will save data space in the computer as unfilled fields are not stored in the data file. +
* **Cons:** It will be harder for developers to understand the inner working of the enhancement.
====

// end::optionalfields[]

// tag::imagestorage[]
=== Image Storage Mechanism
Each contact in Augustine can be assigned a photo so that the user can easily identify a contact within Augustine. If the user did not assign a photo
to a contact, a default photo will be assigned to the contact instead.

===== Implementation Details
The Image Storage Mechanism is activated when the user executes an add, edit or delete command. Photos of all contacts in Augustine are stored in the
`data/images` folder to centralize the storage of the photos. The photos are also renamed to follow a fixed format where the photos are named as
contact_email_address.jpg. By centralizing the storage of the photos and naming the photos in a standardized format, each photo in the
`data/images` folder can be easily identified to a contact within Augustine.

Upon the startup of Augustine, Augustine will create the `data/edited` folder. The purpose of this folder is to store outdated photos of the
contacts while Augustine is running and enable the restoration of a contact's previous photo when the undo function is executed.
Upon the exit of Augustine, Augustine will delete both the folder and all the photos in the folder.

===== During add command
When adding a new contact, Augustine will do the following.

. Check if the user assigned a specific photo for the contact.
.. If a photo is assigned to the contact, Augustine will copy the photo assigned into the `data/images` folder.
.. If no photo is assigned to the contact, Augustine will copy the default photo instead.
. Rename copied photo as contact_email_address.jpg
. Update the photo reference path in the Photo object of the contact.

For example. if `add n/John Doe e/john@example.com dp/photo.jpg` is executed, Augustine will copy the photo `photo.jpg` to `data/images` folder
and also name the copied photo as `john@example.com.jpg`.

_Figure X_ below shows the activity diagram of the Image Storage Mechanism during an add command.

[caption="Figure X: "]
.Activity Diagram of Image Storage Mechanism
image::addPhotoActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]

===== During edit command
As each photo in the `data/images` folder are named in reference to a contact's email address, there is a need to update the photo if
the email or photo of the contact is updated by the user. There is also a need to ensure that the current photo of the contact remains in the
system so that the photo can be restored if an undo command is executed. Therefore, when the user edits a contact, *one* of the
4 possible cases will occur.

[IMPORTANT]
We are only concern on whether the contact's photo and email address are updated. Thus, modification of other
attributes are not mentioned in the cases below.

. User updates *BOTH* email *AND* photo. +
.. Existing photo of the contact is copied over to 'data/edited' folder.
.. The new photo is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_new_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo is updated to the file path of the copied photo.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.
.. Contact's existing photo is copied to `data/edited` folder.
.. Contact's existing photo is deleted from `data/images` folder.

. User updates *ONLY* photo. +
.. Existing photo of the contact is copied over to 'data/edited' folder.
.. The new photo is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.

[NOTE]
The new photo for the contact will overwrite the existing photo for the contact in the `/data/images` folder.

[start = 3]
. User updates *ONLY* email address. +
.. Existing photo of the contact is copied over to 'data/edited` folder.
.. The existing photo is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_new_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo is updated to the file path of the new photo.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.
.. Contact's existing photo is copied to `data/edited` folder.
.. Contact's existing photo is deleted from the `data/images` folder.

. User *DID NOT* update email address *AND* photo. +
.. Photo remains unchanged.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.

Below is a code snippet of the updateCasesForPhoto method in the `UniquePersonList` class, The method determines which of the 4 cases
an edit command belongs to.

[source,java]

===== During delete command
When a contact is deleted from Augustine, the photo of the contact will be deleted from the `data/images` folder. To facilitate the restoration of
the photo of the contact during an undo command, there is a need to ensure that the photo remains in the system. Therefore, when the user deletes a
contact, Augustine will proceed to do the following.

. Copy the photo of the contact into `data/edited` folder.
. Delete the contact from Augustine.
. Delete the photo of the contact in `data/images` folder.

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Storing of contact's photo#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a copy of the photo and store it in data/images folder. +

* **Pros:** Modifications to the original photo source will not affect the contact's photo. +
* **Cons:** Additional storage space on the computer is required to store each contact's photo. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 :** Store the file path of the photo source entered by the user. +

* **Pros:** Additional storage space on the computer is not required. +
* **Cons:** Modifications such as deletion or moving of the photo source will affect the display of the contact's photo. +

=== NUSmods integration
Each contact in Augustine can be contain a `NUSmodules` which stores all their modules and lesson slots.
Augustine utilizes https://nusmods.com to display through the browser. The current academic year and semester is set inside config.json

===== Implementation details
Timetables are stored in `NusModules` class and each `Person` will have a `NusModules` if they have a timetable.
`NusModules` uses a `HashMap<String moduleCode, HashMap<String lessonType, String lessonSlot>>` to store the modules.

===== nusmods Command
Modules are added, edited and deleted using the `nusmod` command.
The command will be phase by `NusmodCommandParser` and executed in `NusmodCommand`.
As `NusmodCommand` changes the AddressBook.xml, it will inherit from `UndoableCommands`.
A flag will be used to tell if the user wants to parse a url, add or delete a module.

The command `nusmod 2 t/add m/CS1231 sec/2 tut/9` will modify the schedule of the second person in the list
by adding a module with the `moduleCode` CS1231 with the `lessonType` "sec" and "tut", with `lessonSlot` 2 and 9 respectively.

To edit, the same command is use, new `lessonType` and `lessonSlot` will overwrite previous data. To delete, `nusmod 2 t/delete m/CS1231` can be used.

The diagram below shows how the command handles different flags.

[caption="Figure 3.6.1: "]
.Activity Diagram of NusmodsCommands
image::NusmodsCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

===== Storing NUSmodules in the AddressBook.xml

To store in the AddressBook.xml, `NusModules` needs to be able to converted into XML format and back (see part in red border in class diagram below).

[caption="Figure 3.6.2: "]
.Class Diagram of Storage
image::StorageClassDiagramNusmods.png[width="500"]

In the xml, the data will be stored as such:
[source,xml]
----
<nusModule moduleCode="CS1231">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">9</lesson>
</nusModule>
<nusModule moduleCode="CS2010">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">1</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="LEC">3</lesson>
</nusModule>
----

Process converting from AddressBook.xml to `NUSModule` (see code snippets below): ::
. In `XMLAdaptedPerson`, a ArrayList is created and each <nusModule> from AddressBook.xml file will an `XMLAdaptedNusModule` in it.
. Each `XMLAdaptedNusModule` will read the moduleCode and get the corresponding list of lessons by calling `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons`
. `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` will read the lessonType and respective lesson slot and return those values.

[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedPerson {
    ...
    @XmlElement(name = "nusModule")
    private List<XmlAdaptedNusModule> nusModules = new ArrayList<>();
    ...
}
----

[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedNusModule {
    @XmlAttribute
    private String moduleCode;
    @XmlElement(name = "lesson")
    private List<XmlAdaptedModuleLessons> nusLessons = new ArrayList<>();
    ...
}
----
[source,java]
----
public class XmlAdaptedModuleLessons {

    @XmlAttribute
    private String lessonType;
    @XmlValue
    private String lessonSlot;
    ...
}
----



Converting from `NUSModule` back to AddressBook.xml is simply a similar process in reverse.
Both `XMLAdaptedNusModule` and `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` have methods for converting to and fro.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Displaying of schedule#
====
**Alternative 1:** Use javafx to draw the schedule +

* **Pros:** Flexibility with visuals and capabilities +
* **Cons:** Much more work will need to be done. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use browser to go to NusMods and use their system to display the schedule +

* **Pros:** Need to do less work as much of the framework is already done +
* **Cons:** Less flexibility and reliance on external servers which might be subjected to changes. Also limited to NUS modules.

---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Storing of schedule#
====
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Store it as a `HashMap<String moduleCode, HashMap<String lessonType, String lessonSlot>>` +

* **Cons:** More complicated to store in xml  +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Store it as one long string that is similar to the query to nusmods +

* **Pros:** As it is a single string, it will be easier to store. And being the same format as the query, less work needs to be done when fetching the webpage +
* **Cons:** Need to parse when want to modify part of the string, then reformat it back into a string, which can be inefficient
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Command to edit timetables#
====
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Create new command to add/edit timetables  +

* **Pros:** Codebase can be kept neater as it will be more cohesive +
* **Cons:** User will need to know more commands +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Modify currently existing Edit command to handle timetables too +

* **Pros:** User will not need to know more commands +
* **Cons:** It can be confusing for user if one command does too many things, also reduce cohesion in the program.

// tag::findMechanism[]
=== Filter and Sort Mechanism for contact list

The find and list commands is facilitated by the Model and Logic Component. They provide the user with the option to
filter and sort the contact list.

===== Implementation Details

When Augustine starts, the contact list data are extracted from data\addressbook.xml and stored in a
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object in `ModelManager`. This object is referenced to a `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object which is bound to the User Interface (UI) of Augustine. Any changes to the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object will be reflected on Augustine UI contact list display.

The contact list can be filtered or sorted using the mechanism below.

. [red]*Filtering contact list using find command*
+
--
The find command allows the user to filter the contact list by either name, tag or both.
The contact list data is stored in a `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object. This object can be filtered
by making use of the `java.util.stream.Stream` interface which uses a predicate to filter the
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object.

[NOTE]
A predicate is a lambda expression for defining the find command filter criteria.

Depending on the find command specified by the user, a different predicate statement will be
created (see code snippet below). The predicate statement will define how the contact list’s
data in the `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object are filtered.

[source, java]
----
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

    if (!namekeywords.isEmpty() && !tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword) && person.containsTags(tagkeywords));
    } else if (!namekeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword));
    } else if (!tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return person.containsTags(tagkeywords);
    } else {
        //should not occur at all.
        return false;
    }
}
----
--

. [red]*Sorting the contact list*
+
--
The find and list commands allows users to sort the contact list by alphabetical order of either *address*,
*email*, *name* or *tag*. The `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is referenced to a `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object which is bound to the Augustine UI. The order of the contact list's data in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>`
object will be the same as the list displayed in the Augustine UI.

[NOTE]
The word “referenced” means that the contact list’s data in the `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is the
exact same as the contact list’s data in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson> object. Any changes to the data in the
`FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object will be reflected in the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object.

Depending on the sort option (address, email, name or tag), the contact list will be sorted differently (see code snippet below).

[source,java]
----

            return o1.getName().fullName.toUpperCase().compareTo(o2.getName().fullName.toUpperCase());
         }
     };

     if (sortOrder == 1) {
         //sort by tags
         sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
             @Override
             public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
                 TreeSet<Tag> o1SortedTags = new TreeSet<Tag>(o1.getTags());
                 TreeSet<Tag> o2SortedTags = new TreeSet<Tag>(o2.getTags());

                 if (o1SortedTags.size() == 0) {
                    return 1;

                    return o1SortedTags.first().tagName.compareTo(o2SortedTags.first().tagName);
                 }
             }
         };
     } else if (sortOrder == 2) {
         //sort by emails
         sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
             @Override
             public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
                return o1.getEmailAddress().value.toUpperCase().compareTo(o2.getEmailAddress().value.toUpperCase());
             }

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method to filter contact list by custom fields (eg. name, tag, email, etc...)#
====
**Alternative 1:** Filter contact list based on user defined keywords +

* **Pros:** Users will only be required to type `find keywords`. The programme will automatically find all users related to the keywords. This way, user experience will be enhanced since Augustine handles the find smartly. +
* **Cons:** The find command might display unnecessary results which are related to the keywords but not what the user wants. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use prefix to define fields +

* **Pros:** There will be more flexibility for users when using the find command and the find results will be more user specific. +
* **Cons:** The find command might contain too many fields and becomes too confusing for the user.

=== Email Mechanism

The email mechanism is facilitated by the `Email` component. It allows the sending of email via an external library, JavaMail.
The sections below will explain how the email mechanism works and some of the design considerations.

===== Implementation Details

Augustine makes use of the email command to send an email. The activity diagram shows what happens when the user enters the email command.

[caption="Figure 28. "]
.Activity diagram for email
image::EmailActivityDiagram.png[]

There are 3 classes, `EmailLogin`, `EmailSend` and `EmailCompose` in the `EmailManager` class that facilitates the email process:

* `*EmailLogin*`: Handles the storing of login details and verifies that the user’s email is a gmail account using regular expression.
* `*EmailCompose*`: Handles the composing and drafting of email using a `MessageDraft` object which stores the email’s message, subject and recipients’ email.
* `*EmailSend*`: Handles the sending of email by setting up the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (link:#SMTP[SMTP]) connection for sending email via JavaMail API.
The email is rejected if the `MessageDraft` object in `EmailCompose` is empty or the login details in `EmailLogin` is invalid.

The sequence diagram below shows how the component interacts with one another when the user enters an email command.

[NOTE]
*Email* in diagram below = “email em/message to send es/subject el/adam@gmail.com:password et/send”

[caption="Figure 29. "]

The diagram below shows how the email draft tab in the Augustine User interface (UI) is updated when the `EventCenter` reacts to the `EmailDraftChangedEvent` in Figure 29.

[caption="Figure 31. "]
.Events Driven Nature of Email
image::EmailSequenceDiagramEvents.png[width="700"]

===== Usage of JavaMal API

The `Email` component uses an external library, JavaMail to send email out from Augustine. The code snippet below sets
up the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (link:#SMTP[SMTP]) for sending email.

[source,java]
----
private void prepEmailProperties() {
    props = new Properties();
    props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
    props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.port", "465");
    props.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.class", "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory");
    props.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");
}

/**
* Sends email out using JavaMail API
*
* @param login email login account
* @param pass email login password
* @param message message to send
* @throws AuthenticationFailedException if gmail account can't be logged in
*/
private void sendingEmail(String login, String pass, ReadOnlyMessageDraft message)
        throws AuthenticationFailedException {
    final String username = login;
    final String password = pass;

    Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
        @Override
        protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
        }
    });

    try {
        Message newMessage = new MimeMessage(session);
        newMessage.setFrom(new InternetAddress(username));
        newMessage.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, message.getRecipientsEmails());
        newMessage.setSubject(message.getSubject());
        newMessage.setText(message.getMessage());

        Transport.send(newMessage);
    } catch (AuthenticationFailedException e) {
        throw new AuthenticationFailedException();
    } catch (MessagingException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
----

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method for sending email#
====
**Alternative 1:** Use a pop up default email client +

* **Pros:** Users will have more control over the editing of email content when using an email client. +
* **Cons:** The email feature will not be part of Augustine. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use JavaMail API +

* **Pros:** The email feature will be send from Augustine. +
* **Cons:** Users will have less control over the email content and the email will be less secure. +
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method to identify the recipient email list#
====
**Alternative 1:** Add Recipient Email List using prefix in Email Command +

* **Pros:** Users can control who to send the email to using the command line interface. +
* **Cons:** Users will have less flexibility and might have to type a long email command if there are more than
 one recipients. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Select recipient email list based on last displayed contact list +

* **Pros:** Users will not need to type a long email command for multiple recipients. +
* **Cons:** Users will have to execute the find command to get the desired list of recipients first before they can
 execute the email command +

// tag::birthday[]
=== Birthday Tab

The birthday tab is facilitated by the `Model`, `Logic`, and `UI` components. It allows the user to display the main
contact list sorted by birth dates. A contact whose birthday is closest to the current system time will be displayed
first. If a contact should be celebrating his birthday today, then his contact card will be highlighted in blue.

===== Implementation Details

There are several components that are key to the implementation this functionality:

===== Birthdate class

Every contact is required to have a blank `-` or a valid `dd/mm/yyyy` date stored in its Birthdate field, which is
enforced through the `BIRTHDATE_VALIDATION_REGEX` String implemented in the class, failing which will cause an
`IllegalValueException` to be thrown.

===== sortBirthdate method

The `sortBirthdate` method is a method added onto `ModelManager`. It updates as the main contact list changes
and runs the following sorting algorithm on a separate `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object:

[source, java]
----
public void sortBirthdate() {

    Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {

       public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
            String birthdate1 = o1.getBirthdate().value;

            String birthdate2 = o2.getBirthdate().value;
            DateTimeFormatter format = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

            LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
            LocalDate date1;
            LocalDate date2;

            try {
                date1 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate1, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date1 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            try {
                date2 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate2, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date2 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            if (date1.isBefore(today)) {
                date1 = date1.withYear(date1.getYear() + 1);
            }

            if (date2.isBefore(today)) {
                date2 = date2.withYear(date2.getYear() + 1);
            }

            return date1.compareTo(date2);
            }
    };

    sortedPersonsListBirthdate.setComparator(sort);
}
----

By converting the birthdates in question to contain the same year as the current system time, we check if the updated date
is before or after today's date. If that date has already passed, increment the year by one. You could think of the
updated dates as the date of the next birthday celebration for each contact.

For example, running this algorithm in November 2017 on a contact with a birthdate of `15/02/1995` would update it
to `15/02/2018` in the sorting process.

Afterwards it is simply a matter of sorting the dates normally.

===== LeftDisplayPanel class

The new `SortedList` will then be passed as a separate parameter into the `LeftDisplayPanel` constructor along the
main contact list. This new list, sorted by birthdates, will be displayed on a separate tab in the left display panel.

===== PersonCardBirthday class

Through a `setColor` method, a contact's card will be highlighted if his birthday is today (system time). This is
achieved in a similar fashion as the above birthday sort. By updating a contact's birthdate's year to that of today's
as such:

[source, java]
----
date1 = LocalDate.parse(person.getBirthdate().value, format).withYear(now.getYear());
----

we can easily compare that date with today's date. If they are equal, the contact's birthday is today, and through
the `SetStyle` method from the Java API we can easily update the colour to highlight this.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method for displaying the sorted birthday list#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using a command +

* **Pros:** Fewer tabs, easier to implement. +
* **Cons:** This functionality will be less intuitive. A user might not be so likely to input a command regularly
 just to check for upcoming birthdays. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using a separate tab +

* **Pros:** User can check for upcoming birthdays without affecting the regular functionality of Augustine. There
 is no need for the contact list to be re-sorted every time, and the birthday tab updates in real-time. +
* **Cons:** An extra tab is harder to implement, and the constant checking of birthdates for sorting and highlighting
 might cost some performance. +
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Format requirements for birthdate field#
====
**Alternative 1:** To allow any reasonable date formats such as d/mm, dd/m, dd.mm.yy , dd-mm-yyyy +

* **Pros:** Users have more control over their preferred formats. +
* **Cons:** Extremely difficult to account for the different variations and all their permutations, causing the sort
implementation to be overly complicated. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Restrict input to dd/mm/yyyy +

* **Pros:** Consistent and simpler implementation. +
* **Cons:** More restrictive, user might intuitively try to input a date like 1/12/1983 which Augustine would reject. +
====

=== Instagram Tab

The Instagram tab is facilitated by the `Model`, `Logic`, and `UI` components. It allows the user to view a contact's
Instagram profile page. If a contact does not contain the necessary username information, the tab will redirect the user to
Instagram's home page.

===== Implementation Details

The following diagram (Figure 5.10.1) highlights the flow of logic when the user inputs the Instagram command:

image::InstagramDiagram.png[width="813"]
_Figure 5.10.1 : Flow of Instagram command_

There are several components that are key to the implementation this functionality:

===== UserId class

Every contact is required to have a blank `-` or a valid `alphanumeric` Instagram ID stored in its `UserId` field, which
is enforced through the `USERNAME_VALIDATION_REGEX` String implemented in the class, failing which will cause an
`IllegalValueException` to be thrown.

===== loadInsta method

The `loadInsta` method is a method added to the `BrowerPanel` class. When a `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is raised,
this method will be called to load the required Instagram page. Since it is ensured that a '-' will populate the `UserId`
field even if the information is not available, an `if` statement allows us to go to the Instagram home page in
the case of unavailable information.

Instagram profile page URLs are formatted as such: `https://www.instagram.com/<userId>/`, so it is a simple matter of
appending the contact's UserId to `https://www.instagram.com/` to load the required page.

[source, java]
----
public void loadInsta(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

    if (person.getUserId().value.equals("-")) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> instaBrowser.getEngine().load("https://www.instagram.com/"));
    } else {
        Platform.runLater(() -> instaBrowser.getEngine().load(new StringBuilder()
        .append("https://www.instagram.com/").append(person.getUserId()).toString()));
   }
}
----

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Behaviour when `UserId` is not available#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using Instagram's API to search Instagram with the contact's `Name`. +

* **Pros:** Huge benefit to user convenience since a user is not likely to have Instagram IDs of every contact. +
* **Cons:** As of recent years, Instagram has significantly restricted its API usage, we would not be able to implement this
  without going through a permissions request and Instagram's approval, which is excessive for a student project. +
====
====

=== Backup function

The Backup function allows the user to save his existing data on a backup file.

===== Implementation Details

`Model` simply raises a `BackupAddressBookEvent` when the command is executed, instead of directly asking `Storage` to
save the backup file to the hard disk. The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the
`Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them, helping to reduce direct coupling between
components.


The diagram below shows how the various components react to this command:

== Documentation

Documentations for Augustine are done in acsiidoc.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc provides more flexibility in formatting, although it is more complex than Markdown.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the `AsciiDoc plugin` for IntelliJ Idea IDE, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc`
files in real-time.

---

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to publish GitHub Pages using Travis.

---

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with -> Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

Tests are a vital part in the development of Augustine as they ensure that the existing features in Augustine are working as intended.
 They also ensure that new features introduced into Augustine do not conflict with existing features.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests in Augustine.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ IDEA IDE JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

Open a console and run the following command:

- Windows       : `gradlew clean allTests`
- Mac/Linux     : `./gradlew clean allTests`

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library that Augustine uses, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen, allowing the developer to continue using the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the following command:

- Windows   : `gradlew clean headless allTests`
- Mac/Linux : `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests in Augustine is the 3rd method as the first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/
resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

---

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests available in Augustine:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test Augustine by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components within Augustine. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ that test the lowest level methods/classes within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that test the integration of multiple code units that are assumed to be working within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests that tests multiple code units as well as how they are connected together within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

---

=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: Unable to execute gradlew commands.**

* Reason: Java path is configured wrongly, or more than one versions of Java are detected on the system.
* Solution: Uninstall all Java files and reinstall the latest `Java JDK 8` available.
For *Windows platform*, ensure that the system environment variables are properly configured.

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependency, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Development Operations

Usage of automation and monitoring tools are a vital part of Augustine's developmental process. These tools help to reduce hiccups in
Augustine's development as stability of Augustine is not compromised despite the constant addition of new features.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

---

=== Continuous Integration (CI)

Augustine uses both Travis and AppVeyor to perform _Continuous Integration_ during it's developmental process.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> to learn how to use Travis and AppVeyor for CI.

---

=== Making a Release

We publish a new release everytime a new feature is added onto Augustine.

Here are the steps to create a new release for Augustine.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file that you created in Step 2.

---

=== Managing Dependencies

Augustine uses Gradle to manage it's dependencies on third-party libraries. Gradle will automatically download the dependencies automatically.

Other ways of managing dependencies are as follows:

.  Include those libraries in the repo which bloats the repo size.
.  Require developers to download those libraries manually which creates extra work for developers.

[NOTE]
Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

== Future Enhancements

Augustine is still under heavy development. This section lists various enhancements and features which are in consideration for future updates.
Each improvement is expressed as a problem to be fixed along with its possible solutions.

=== Schedule

====
Problem::
The schedule feature uses NUSmods heavily, as a result, it is only able to display NUS lessons and requires an active internet connection.

Solution::
We could render the timetable with JavaFX instead of relying the browser to fetch NUSmods website. This will require storing module information which contains time of lessons which can be obtain from the NUSmods API in .json format.
::
This will eliminate the need to have a constant connection and open up the possibility of adding non-NUS related activities to the schedule.

====
====
Problem::
Users are able to enter non-existent module codes, lesson types and lesson slots as long as they fullfill the regular expression.

Solution::
Instead of using regular expression, we could check against module information obtained from NUSmods API.
====

'''

=== UI

====
Problem::
When there are no contacts to be listed, the area where the personListView is suppose to be will display a white box instead.
====

'''

=== Email

====
Problem::
Augustine stores the email login username and password as a unencrypted String variable which is insecure.
====

====
Problem::
Augustine is considered as an insecure application. Hence, “allow less secure apps to log in” must be enabled in the Gmail settings in order to send an email.
====

====
Problem::
Augustine only allows text email message to be send. Attachment email is not integrated into Augustine.
