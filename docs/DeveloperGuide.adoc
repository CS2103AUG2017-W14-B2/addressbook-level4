== Software Overview

Augustine is a virtual Address Book that seeks to assist students who are currently pursuing their studies in National
University of Singapore (NUS). As a virtual Address Book, Augustine is a comprehensive
software to store contact details of their friends. This enables students to take advantage of
technology to assist them in managing aspects of their daily life and easily query contact details of their friends at
any time without a need to refer to a physical Address Book (which might get lost) when they require a friend’s contact details.

In Augustine, users primarily communicate with the software via Command Line Interface (CLI). Augustine also contains a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) component to provide visual feedback to commands that are performed.

Developed in Java, Augustine can cater to all students in NUS as it runs in both Windows and Unix environment.

== About

This Developer Guide seeks to assist both experienced and new developers that are either interested in contributing to
the development of Augustine or wishes to know more about its underlying mechanisms.

The Developer Guide will first cover the prerequisites for Augustine before covering on
various components in Augustine, in-depth explanation on the implementation of certain mechanisms in Augustine and design considerations
behind those implementations and the documentation of what the development team underwent
to make Augustine to what it is today.

== Getting Started
Before proceeding further with the Developer Guide, ensure that you have achieved the following requirements:

=== Prerequisites
Please install the following:

. *Java SE Development Kit* (JDK) `v1.8.0_60` or later. +
You can download the latest JDK from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here]

[NOTE]
Augustine will *not work* with any version of Java earlier than `Java 8.6`.

. *Intellij IDEA* Integrated Development Environment (IDE). +
You can download Intellij IDEA IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here]

[NOTE]
Either version of Intellij IDEA IDE will work.

By default, Intellij IDEA IDE has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. Ensure that both Gradle and JavaFx plugins are enabled.
If you have disabled them, go to `File > Settings > Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. *Fork* this repo to your own Github account, and *clone* the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ IDEA IDE and you should see the Welcome Screen.

[NOTE]
If you do not see the welcome screen, click `File > Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.

. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of your JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Press kbd:[Ctr; + Tab + T] *simultaneously* to open a console in Intellij IDEA IDE and execute the following command:
- For Windows   : `gradlew processResources`
- For Mac/Linux : `./gradlew processResources`

[NOTE]
The command should finish executing with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `src\main\java\seedu\address\MainApp.java` in Intellij IDEA IDE and try executing a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run all tests] by right clicking on the `src/test/java` folder in Intellij IDEA IDE and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
*Ensure* that all test cases pass before you start coding.

=== Configurations to do before coding
Now that you have successfully imported Augustine's source code into your computer, do ensure that you have completed the following before
you commence coding:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows the coding standard set forth by https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic].

While IntelliJ IDEA IDE default style is mostly compliant with it, minor modifications to the default settings is required to fully comply
with our coding standard.

Apply the following modifications to tweak the settings to comply with our coding standard:

. Go to:
- For Windows/Linux : `File > Settings...`.
- For macOS         : `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences...`.
. Select `Editor > Code Style > Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the
import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`,
`import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

[TIP]
You can also configure IntelliJ IDE to assist you in checking for style-compliance as you code. See <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>>
to learn how to configure it.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a
separate product instead of contributing to `CS2103AUG2017-W14-B2/main`, you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in both
`DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your forked repo.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration (CI)

CI tools such as Travis and AppVeyor should be set up to prevent integration problems during development.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>) to learn how to set them up.

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures Augustine works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms as
Travis checks for Unix-based platforms while AppVeyor checks for Windows-based platforms.

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Understand the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Software Architecture

This section covers how Augustine is designed while also providing an overview of the components in Augustine.

=== Architecture Design

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 4.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Augustine. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

===== Overview

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

** At Augustine's launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
** At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play an important role at the architecture level:

** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
** `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to Augustine's log file.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : Interacts with user through the user interface (UI) of Augustine.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes commands specified by user.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of Augustine in-memory.
* link:#email-component[*`Email`*] : Sends email via JavaMail API.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

====
*Structure of `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `Email` component*

Each of the five components (UI, Logic, Model, Storage and Email)

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

====

=== Architecture Style

Augustine implements an Event-drive architecture style as explained below.

===== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 1 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
The `Model` simply raises an `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
The event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without the `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

---

=== Components

This section covers an overview of some of the components in the architecture.

==== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Structure of the UI component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of smaller parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LeftDisplayPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `MessageDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` and `BrowserPanel`. All of these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component
The Logic Component is where the user input is being parsed and the corresponding commands
are being called from. The newly created command is then executed and depending on the
command executed, the Model component may be accessed.

_Figure X_ below shows an Overview of the process within Logic Component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

_Figure X_ below shows the detailed process of how the Command class in the Logic Component works

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 4.3.1a_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The process of the Logic Component is as follow:

. LogicManager is called by `handleCommandInputChange` method in the UI Component and User Input is passed into LogicManager.
. LogicManager calls AddressBookParser to parse User Input into two Strings, commandWord and arguments.
. AddressBookParser calls the relevant CommandParser, if it exists and parse the arguments into a fixed format.
If there is no relevant CommandParser, AddressBookParser will call the Command instead.

  [NOTE]
  The Clear, List, History, Exit, Help, Undo, Redo commands do not have it's own CommandParser

. Relevant CommandParser then calls the actual Command to execute the user command.
. Command executes the user command.
. Model component may then be updated depending on the Command Type.

  [TIP]
  Model Component will be called by Add, Delete, Clear, Edit, Find, List, Redo and Undo command.

. the result of the Command which is stored in CommandResult will then be returned to LogicManager
. The CommandResult is then returned to `handleCommandInputChange` method in the UI Component for display to the user.

_Figure X_ below shows the sequence diagram of the process within the Component when the command
`Delete 1` is entered by the user.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure X : Sequence Diagram within the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

==== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.3 : Structure of the Model component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores an `Email` component which handle sending email via JavaMail API
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Email component

image::EmailComponent.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.4 : Structure of the Email component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/email/Email.java[`Email.java`]

The `Email` component,

* uses a `EmailLogin` class to store user's email login Details.
* uses a `EmailSend` class to process and send email via JavaMail API through SMTP protocol.
* uses a `EmailCompose` class to store the data of email message drafts.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `MessageDraft` object which can be retrieved from `EmailCompose` class, such that the `MessageDisplay` UI can be bound to this list which automatically updates when the data in the `messageDraft` object change.

// tag::StorageComponent[]
==== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.5 : Structure of the Storage component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

// end::StorageComponent[]

==== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

===== Implementation Details

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

===== UndoableCommands

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the above diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks needs to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

==== UndoRedoStack

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand`#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +

* **Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
* **Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +

* **Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
* **Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +

* **Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
* **Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +

* **Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
* **Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
* **Additional Info:** See our discussion at https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +

* **Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
* **Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +

* **Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
* **Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
====
---

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.
The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.

The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).

There are four different logging levels you can specify depending on the amount of verbosity you want:

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
The config file and path is specified in the `Config` class.

The `Config` class will be initialized by the `MainApp` and the constructed `Config` object will be kept as a protected variable.
When initialized, the `Config` class will read and save the values of parameters in the configuration file. The `MainApp` then passes the `Config` object into classes which require it (e.g. `MainWindow`)

// tag::optionalfields[]
=== Optional Fields in a Contact

Contacts in Augustine are required to have *both their name and email address* filled. The other fields of a contact can be left out.

===== Implementation Details

When adding a contact into Augustine, the `AddCommandParser` is used to parse the input entered by the user into the different fields for a contact.

In `AddCommandParser`, Augustine will first check if the two compulsory prefixes, which are used for the name and email fields is present.
If the two compulsory prefixes are not present, Augustine will throw an error message stating Augustine requires both the name and email fields to be
filled.

Next, Augustine will execute the `checkInput` method in `AddCommandParser` to determine if a field is filled by the user. If the field is not filled,
the method will give the value '-' to the field instead to denote that the field is not filled.

The code snippet below shows how the `checkInput` method checks if a field is filled by the user.

[source,java]
----
private static Optional<String> checkInput(Optional<String> userInput) {
        return Optional.of(userInput.orElse("-"));
    }
----

After assigning values to the different fields of a contact, Augustine will then proceed to call the `parseField` method in `ParserUtil` to parse
the user input method into the different objects required for the `Person` class before adding the contact into Augustine.

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Detect unfilled fields in user input#
====
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if value is present, if value is not present, return a '-' as the value instead. +

* **Pros:** Simple for developers to understand the inner working of the enhancement. +
* **Cons:** All fields are still stored in AddressBook, leading to wastage of space as fields that are not used by the User for each contact are still being stored. +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Detect if the field exist in AddressBook.xml, if the field does not exist for a contact, display the field in the PersonCard as unfilled. +

* **Pros:** Save data space in the computer as unfilled fields are not stored in the data file. +
* **Cons:** Harder for developers to understand the inner working of the enhancement.
====

// end::optionalfields[]

// tag::imagestorage[]
=== Image Storage Mechanism
Each contact in Augustine can be given a Display Picture of the User's choosing so that the User can easily
identify a contact within Augustine.

[NOTE]
A default image will be given to the contact if the User: +
1. did not specify an image for the contact during the adding of the contact into Augustine. +
2. remove the contact's Display Picture during an edit.

===== Implementation Details
The Display Picture given to a contact will be copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as "contact's_email_address.jpg".
By renaming the Display Picture as "contact's_email_address.jpg", Augustine is able to associate each image in the `/data/images` folder to a contact
in Augustine. However, such implementation means that a contact's Display Picture may have to be renamed if the contact's email is updated.

When the User edits a Contact in Augustine, *only one* of the 4 possible cases will occur:

[IMPORTANT]
We are only concern if whether the Contact's Display Picture and email address is updated and thus possible modification of other attributes are
not mentioned in the cases below.

. User updates *BOTH* email *AND* display picture. +
.. The new display picture is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_new_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo reference is updated to the new display picture file path.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.
.. Contact's old photo is deleted from the computer.

. User updates *ONLY* display picture. +
.. The new display picture is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo reference is updated to the new display picture file path.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.

[NOTE]
The new display picture for the Contact will overwrite the existing display picture for the Contact in the `/data/images` folder.

[start = 3]
. User updates *ONLY* email address. +
.. The current display picture is copied over to the `data/images` folder and renamed as *"contact_new_email_address.jpg"*.
.. Contact's photo reference is updated to the new display picture file path.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.
.. Contact's old photo is deleted from the computer.

. User *DID NOT* update email address AND display picture. +
.. Image is not updated.
.. Contact is updated in Augustine.

If the Contact is deleted from Augustine by the User, the contact's Display Picture is moved to `/data/edited` folder so that the contact's previous
Display Picture can be restored if the user executes a redo command after changing the Display Picture.

[NOTE]
The `/data/edited` folder will be deleted from the system when the user exits Augustine.

Refer to the _image_ below to see the activity diagram of how the Display Picture of a contact could be modified
and what are the actions done within Augustine.

[caption="Image: "]
.Activity Diagram of Image Storage Mechanism
image::ActivityDiagramImageStorage.png[width="640"]

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** ??#
====
**Alternative 1 current choice:** Create a local copy of the Display Picture in the data/images folder +

* **Pros:** Removal of the original image will not affect the display of a contact's Display Picture. +
* **Cons:** Additional storage space on the computer is required to store the local copy of the Display Picture. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Store the file path of the chosen Display Picture in each Contact. +

* **Pros:** Additional storage space on the computer is not required. +
* **Cons:** User is unable to move or change the Display Picture as any modification to it will prevent Augustine from
displaying the Display Picture.

// end::imagestorage[];

=== NUSmods integration
Each contact in Augustine can be contain a `NUSmodules` which stores all their modules and lesson slots.
Augustine utilizes https://nusmods.com to display through the browser. The current academic year and semester is set inside config.json

===== Implementation details
Timetables are stored in `NusModules` class and each `Person` will have a `NusModules` if they have a timetable.
`NusModules` uses a `HashMap<String moduleCode, HashMap<String lessonType, String lessonSlot>>` to store the modules.

===== nusmods Command
Modules are added, edited and deleted using the `nusmod` command.
The command will be phase by `NusmodCommandParser` and executed in `NusmodCommand`.
As `NusmodCommand` changes the AddressBook.xml, it will inherit from `UndoableCommands`.
A flag will be used to tell if the user wants to parse a url, add or delete a module.

The command `nusmod 2 t/add m/CS1231 sec/2 tut/9` will modify the schedule of the second person in the list
by adding a module with the `moduleCode` CS1231 with the `lessonType` "sec" and "tut", with `lessonSlot` 2 and 9 respectively.

To edit, the same command is use, new `lessonType` and `lessonSlot` will overwrite previous data. To delete, `nusmod 2 t/delete m/CS1231` can be used.

The diagram below shows how the command handles different flags.

===== Storing NUSmodules in the AddressBook.xml

To store in the AddressBook.xml, `NusModules` needs to be able to converted into XML format and back. See link:#StorageComponent[Storage component] for diagram.

In the xml, the data will be stored as such:
[source,xml]
----
<nusModule moduleCode="CS1231">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">9</lesson>
</nusModule>
<nusModule moduleCode="CS2010">
    <lesson lessonType="SEC">1</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="TUT">2</lesson>
    <lesson lessonType="LEC">3</lesson>
</nusModule>
----

Process converting from AddressBook.xml to `NUSModule`: ::
. In `XMLAdaptedPerson`, a ArrayList is created and each <nusModule> from AddressBook.xml file will an `XMLAdaptedNusModule` in it.
. Each `XMLAdaptedNusModule` will read the moduleCode and get the corresponding list of lessons by calling `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons`
. `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` will read the lessonType and respective lesson slot and return those values.

Converting from `NUSModule` back to AddressBook.xml is simply a similar process in reverse.
Both `XMLAdaptedNusModule` and `XMLAdaptedModuleLessons` have methods for converting to and fro.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Displaying of schedule#
====
**Alternative 1:** Use javafx to draw the schedule +

* **Pros:** Flexibility with visuals and capabilities +
* **Cons:** Much more work will need to be done. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use browser to go to NusMods and use their system to display the schedule +

* **Pros:** Need to do less work as much of the framework is already done +
* **Cons:** Less flexibility and reliance on external servers which might be subjected to changes. Also limited to NUS modules.
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Storing of schedule#
====
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Store it as a `HashMap<String moduleCode, HashMap<String lessonType, String lessonSlot>>` +

* **Pros:** Easier to modify and extend with other features, more readable in xml +
* **Cons:** More complicated to store in xml  +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Store it as one long string that is similar to the query to nusmods +

* **Pros:** As it is a single string, it will be easier to store. And being the same format as the query, less work needs to be done when fetching the webpage +
* **Cons:** Need to parse when want to modify part of the string, then reformat it back into a string, which can be inefficient
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Command to edit timetables#
====
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Create new command to add/edit timetables  +

* **Pros:** Codebase can be kept neater as it will be more cohesive +
* **Cons:** User will need to know more commands +
====
====
**Alternative 2:** Modify currently existing Edit command to handle timetables too +

* **Pros:** User will not need to know more commands +
* **Cons:** It can be confusing for user if one command does too many things, also reduce cohesion in the program.

=== Find with filter and sort Mechanism

The find command is facilitated by the Model and Logic Component. It provides the user with the option to
filter and sort the contact list.

===== Implementation Details

The contact list in Augustine UI are bound to the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object in `ModelManager`. Any changes
to the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object will result in changes to the results of the contact list displayed in
Augustine UI. The contact list can be filtered or sorted based on the find command executed as explain below.

===== Filtering by arguments

The find command allows users to filter the contact list by either *name* or *tag* or *both.* On application start,
the contact list's data are stored in a `FilteredList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object in `ModelManager`. The contact list are
filtered by making use of `java.util.stream.Stream` interface which can easily filter a list by defining the predicate*.

[NOTE]
A predicate is a lambda expression to define the filtering criteria.

The code snippet below shows how the `Find` command defines the predicate for filtering the contact list.

[source, java]
----
public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {

    if (!namekeywords.isEmpty() && !tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword) && person.containsTags(tagkeywords));
    } else if (!namekeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return namekeywords.stream().anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsNonFullWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword));
    } else if (!tagkeywords.isEmpty()) {
        return person.containsTags(tagkeywords);
    } else {
        //should not occur at all.
        return false;
    }
}
----

===== Sorting by arguments

The find command allows users to sort the filtered contact list results by either *address*, *email*, *name*, *tag*.
The contact list stored in `FilterList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object are referenced to a `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson` object
to implement the sorting algorithm. The `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object is bound to the Augustine UI. Any changes to
the `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object will be reflected on the contact list displayed in Augustine UI.

The code snippet below shows how the `Find` command defines the sorting algorithm for sorting the contact list.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * @param: int
 * 0 = sort by name ascending
 * 1 = sort by tags ascending
 * 2 = sort by email ascending
 * 3 = sort by address ascending
 * Returns a sorted unmodifable view of the list {@code ReadOnlyPerson} backed by the internal list of
 * {@code addressBook}
 */
 public void sortFilteredPersons(int sortOrder) {

     //sort by name by default
     Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
         @Override
         public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
            return o1.getName().fullName.toUpperCase().compareTo(o2.getName().fullName.toUpperCase());
         }
     };

     if (sortOrder == 1) {
         //sort by tags
         sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
             @Override
             public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
                 TreeSet<Tag> o1SortedTags = new TreeSet<Tag>(o1.getTags());
                 TreeSet<Tag> o2SortedTags = new TreeSet<Tag>(o2.getTags());

                 if (o1SortedTags.size() == 0) {
                    return 1;
                 } else if (o2SortedTags.size() == 0) {
                    return -1;
                 } else {
                    return o1SortedTags.first().tagName.compareTo(o2SortedTags.first().tagName);
                 }
             }
         };
     } else if (sortOrder == 2) {
         //sort by emails
         sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
             @Override
             public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
                return o1.getEmailAddress().value.toUpperCase().compareTo(o2.getEmailAddress().value.toUpperCase());
             }
         };
     } else if (sortOrder == 3) {
         //sort by address
         sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {
             @Override
             public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
                 return o1.getAddress().value.toUpperCase().compareTo(o2.getAddress().value.toUpperCase());
             }
         };
     }

     sortedPersonsList.setComparator(sort);
 }

===== Design Considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Find users using custom fields (eg. name, tag, email, etc...)#
====
**Alternative 1:** finding base on user define keywords  +

* **Pros:** User will only be required to type `find keywords`. The programme will automatically find all users related to the keywords. This way, user experience will be enhanced since Augustine handles the find smartly. +
* **Cons:** The find command might display unnecessary results. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use prefix to define fields +

* **Pros:** There will be more flexibility and find results will be more user specific +
* **Cons:** The find command might contain too many fields and becomes confusing.
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Sorting Find Result#
====
**Alternative 1:** Create a Sort command +

* **Pros:** Users can sort the list at any point of time, not only during the find command +
* **Cons:** Users will have to run an extra sort command instead of a one line find command with sort options +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Creating a Find Command with sort options +

* **Pros:** Users will only need to run a single line of code to find users in a sorted list. +
* **Cons:** The find command might become too complex.
====
---

=== Email Mechanism

The email mechanism is facilitated by the `Email component`. It allows the sending of email via using an external
library, JavaMail. The sections below will explain how the email mechanism works and some of the design considerations.

===== Implementation Details

There are 3 classes, `EmailLogin`, `EmailSend`, `EmailCompose`, in the EmailManager that facilitates the email process.
Before the user is able to send an email, the user have to login and compose the email. The section below covers how
each class process an email.

===== EmailCompose

The `EmailCompose` class creates an `MessageDraft` object which stores the email's message, subject and the recipients
emails.

===== EmailLogin

The `EmailLogin` class stores the login details and verifies that the user's email is a gmail account using regular
expression.

===== EmailSend

The `EmailSend` class sets up the connection to send email via `JavaMail` API. The email is rejected if the
`MessageDraft` object in `EmailCompose` is empty or the login details in `EmailLogin` is invalid.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method for sending Email#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using Pop up Default Email Client +

* **Pros:** User have more control over the editing of email content when using an Email Client. +
* **Cons:** The app will no longer be CLI based. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using JavaMail API +

* **Pros:** Email will be sent from the application. +
* **Cons:** User will have less control over the email content and the email will be less secure. +
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Identifying Recipient Email List#
====
**Alternative 1:** Add Recipient Email List using prefix in Email Command +

* **Pros:** Users can control who to email to using CLI. +
* **Cons:** Users will have less flexibility and might have to type a long command if there are more than
 one recipients. +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Select Recipient Email List based on last displayed contact list +

* **Pros:** Users will not need to type a long Email command for multiple recipients. +
* **Cons:** Users will have to execute the find command to get the desired list of recipients first before they can
 execute the email command +
====
---

=== Birthday Tab

The birthday tab is facilitated by the `Model`, `Logic`, and `UI` components. It allows the user to display the main
contact list sorted by birth dates. A contact whose birthday is closest to the current system time will be displayed
first. If a contact should be celebrating his birthday today, then his contact card will be highlighted in blue.

===== Implementation Details

There are several components that are key to the implementation this functionality:

===== Birthdate class

Every contact is required to have a blank `-` or a valid `dd/mm/yyyy` date stored in its Birthdate field, which is
enforced through the `BIRTHDATE_VALIDATION_REGEX` String implemented in the class, failing which will cause an
`IllegalValueException` to be thrown.

===== sortBirthdate method

The `sortBirthdate` method is a method added onto `ModelManager`. It updates as the main contact list changes
and runs the following sorting algorithm on a separate `SortedList<ReadOnlyPerson>` object:

[source, java]
----
public void sortBirthdate() {

    Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> sort = new Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson>() {

       public int compare(ReadOnlyPerson o1, ReadOnlyPerson o2) {
            String birthdate1 = o1.getBirthdate().value;

            String birthdate2 = o2.getBirthdate().value;
            DateTimeFormatter format = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

            LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
            LocalDate date1;
            LocalDate date2;

            try {
                date1 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate1, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date1 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            try {
                date2 = LocalDate.parse(birthdate2, format).withYear(today.getYear());
            } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
                date2 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 30);
            }

            if (date1.isBefore(today)) {
                date1 = date1.withYear(date1.getYear() + 1);
            }

            if (date2.isBefore(today)) {
                date2 = date2.withYear(date2.getYear() + 1);
            }

            return date1.compareTo(date2);
            }
    };

    sortedPersonsListBirthdate.setComparator(sort);
}
----

By converting the birthdates in question to contain the same year as current system time, we check if the updated date
is before or after today's date. If that date has already passed, increment the year by one. You could think of the
updated dates as the date of the most upcoming birthday celebration for each contact.

For example, running this algorithm in November 2017 on a contact with a birthdate of `15/02/1995` would be updated it
to `15/02/2018` in the sorting process.

Afterwards it is simply a matter of sorting the dates normally.

===== LeftDisplayPanel class

The new `SortedList` will then be passed as a separate parameter into the `LeftDisplayPanel` constructor along the
main contact list. This new list, sorted by birthdates, will be displayed on a separate tab in the left display panel.

===== PersonCard class

Through a `setColor` method, a contact's card will be highlighted if his birthday is today (system time). This is
achieved in a similar fashion as the above birthday sort. By updating a contact's birthdate's year to that of today's
as such:

[source, java]
----
date1 = LocalDate.parse(person.getBirthdate().value, format).withYear(now.getYear());
----

we can easily compare that date with today's date. If they are equal, the contact's birthday is today, and through
the `SetStyle` method from the Java API we can easily update the colour to highlight this.

===== Design considerations

[Big]#**Aspect:** Method for displaying the sorted birthday list#
====
**Alternative 1:** Using a command +

* **Pros:** Fewer tabs, easier to implement +
* **Cons:** This functionality will be less intuitive. A user might not be so likely to input a command regularly
 just to check for upcoming birthdays +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using a separate tab +

* **Pros:** User can check for upcoming birthdays without affecting the regular functionality of Augustine. There
 is no need for the contact list to be resorted every time, and the birthday tab updates in real-time. +
* **Cons:** As extra tab is harder to implement, and the constant checking of birthdates for sorting and highlighting
 might cost some performance. +
====
---

[Big]#**Aspect:** Format requirements for birthdate field#
====
**Alternative 1:** To allow any seemingly valid birthday formats such as d/mm, dd/m, dd.mm.yy , dd-mm-yyyy +

* **Pros:** Users have more control over their preferred formats. +
* **Cons:** Extremely difficult to account for the different variation and their permutations, causing the sort
implementation to be overly complicated and inconsistent +
====
====
**Alternative 2 (current choice):** Restrict input to dd/mm/yyyy +

* **Pros:** Consistent and simpler implementation. +
* **Cons:** More restrictive, user might intuitively try to input a date like 1/12/1983 and cause an error prompt. +

== Documentation

Documentations for Augustine are done in acsiidoc.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the `AsciiDoc plugin` for IntelliJ Idea IDE, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc`
files in real-time.

---

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

---

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with -> Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

Tests are a vital part in the development of Augustine as it ensures that the existing features in Augustine are working as intended as well as
ensuring that new features introduced into Augustine has no conflict with the existing features.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests in Augustine.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ IDEA IDE JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

Open a console and run the following command:

- Windows       : `gradlew clean allTests`
- Mac/Linux     : `./gradlew clean allTests`

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library that Augustine uses, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen, allowing the developer to continue using the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the following command:

- Windows   : `gradlew clean headless allTests`
- Mac/Linux : `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests in Augustine is the 3rd method as the first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/
resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

---

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests available in Augustine:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test Augustine by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components within Augustine. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ that test the lowest level methods/classes within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that test the integration of multiple code units that are assumed to be working within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests that tests multiple code units as well as how they are connected together within Augustine. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

---

=== Troubleshoot Testing
**Problem: Unable to execute gradlew commands.**

* Reason: Java path is configured wrongly or more than one version of Java is detected within the system.
* Solution: Uninstall all Java files and reinstall the latest `Java JDK 8` available.
For *Windows platform*, ensure that the system environment variables are properly configured.

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Development Operations

Usage of automation and monitoring tools are a vital part of Augustine's developmental process. These tools help to reduce hiccups in
Augustine's development as stability of Augustine is not compromised despite the constant addition of new features.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

---

=== Continuous Integration (CI)

Augustine uses both Travis and AppVeyor to perform _Continuous Integration_ during it's developmental process.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> to learn how to use Travis and AppVeyor for CI.

---

=== Making a Release

We publish a new release everytime a new feature is added onto Augustine.

Here are the steps to create a new release for Augustine.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file that you created in Step 2.

---

=== Managing Dependencies

Augustine uses Gradle to manage it's dependencies on third-party libraries. Gradle will automatically download the dependencies automatically.

Other ways of managing dependencies are as follows:

.  Include those libraries in the repo which bloats the repo size.
.  Require developers to download those libraries manually which creates extra work for developers.

[NOTE]
Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

== Future Enhancements

Augustine is still under heavy development. This section lists various enhancement and features which are in consideration for future updates.
Each improvement is expressed problem to be fixed followed by possible solutions, if any.

=== Schedule

====
Problem::
The schedule feature uses NUSmods heavily, as a result, it is only able to display NUS lessons and requires an active internet connection.

Solution::
We could render the timetable with JavaFX instead of relying the browser to fetch NUSmods website. This will require storing module information which contains time of lessons which can be obtain from the NUSmods API in .json format.
::
This will eliminate the need to have a constant connection and open up the possibility of adding non-NUS related activities to the schedule.

====
====
Problem::
Users are able to enter non-existent module codes, lesson types and lesson slots as long as they fullfill the regular expression.

Solution::
Instead of using regular expression, we could check against module information obtained from NUSmods API.
====

'''

=== UI

====
Problem::
When there are no contacts to be listed, the area where the personListView is suppose to be will display a white box instead.
